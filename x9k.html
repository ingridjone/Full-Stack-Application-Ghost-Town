            <span class="dialog">“Hi Professor, how are you handling this situation?”</span> You approach Professor Keral, who’s sitting by himself, a bit distanced from the group. <span class="dialog">“Hey, doing good. Now we just have to wait.”</span> He simply says. <span class="dialog">“So do you like being a professor?”</span> You attempt to start a casual conversation. <span class="dialog">“I mean yes, for the most part. My favorite part about being a professor is interacting with the youth, you know? They keep me young.”</span> He responds. <span class="dialog">“For sure, now you have this crazy story to tell them!”</span> You say, to lighten the mood. <span class="dialog">“Yeah, I’ll definitely never forget today.”</span> He seems anxious about something (other than plane crash, of course). It’s probably best to leave him alone.
