            <span class="dialog">“Hey, I just wanted to check on you and make sure you are okay…”.</span> You went up to talk to the brown-haired woman, who’s laying next to what seems to be her teenage son. <span class="dialog">“Hi sweetie, yes everything is okay! Thankfully, I am a doctor, so I was able to help out some of the passengers that sustained injuries while you were unconscious. Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t even introduce myself! My name is Dr. Alamo.”</span> She extends her hand as she introduces herself. Her hand is cold to the touch and her tone is erratic and rushed, but you attribute it to the shock of the incident. <span class="dialog">“I’m glad everything seems okay over here; I’ll go check on other people then.”</span> Just as you are about to leave them alone, you notice how she is sweating and shaking profusely.
