            You stand up and attempt to orientate yourself throughout all the smoke and flames. You hear screams and multiple erratic voices all over the place. <span class="dialog">“Everyone needs to evacuate the plane!”</span> A male voice screams from far away. Your flight instinct kicks in, and instantly you start following the voice, until you reach a group of people gathered at a safe distance far away from the plane. <span class="dialog">“Are you the last one?”</span> You recognize the voice you have been hearing since you regained consciousness. It belongs to a well-dressed older man, but his suit is ruined with scratches and cuts. <span class="dialog">“I don’t know”</span> You manage to say, clearly still in shock. <span class="dialog">“You might be, but we need to make sure. I will go and check the aircraft!”</span> The man urgently responds. <span class="dialog">“You are right, I’ll go with you”</span> you say, feeling your body overflowing from adrenaline. The man suddenly panics and says <span class="dialog">“The plane might explode at any time, it is not safe. This is not the time for you to be a hero.”</span>
