            You go up to the dark-haired woman and check on her. <span class="dialog">“Hi Agent Moore, thanks for offering to check the victim. It is a bit weird how that woman was the only fatality of this crash.”</span> After a couple of seconds, she responds. <span class="dialog">“Absolutely, but we just need to consider ourselves lucky. This could have been much worse. It’s like a twisted game of Russian roulette.”</span> That is certainly true. <span class="dialog">“I am trying to get distracted from this situation, so I wanted to ask what was your trip to Austin for?”</span> You confess. It is true that you don’t want to be left alone with your thoughts in silence, but you also have the feeling that she is hiding something. <span class="dialog">“I see… I was actually called to testify in court.”</span> She seems to be debating if she should expand on her answer. <span class="dialog">“I was accused of abusing my power while on the job, something I absolutely would never do. That is why I am going to fight it in court.”</span> She appears regretful for sharing so much, so she tries to lighten the mood a bit. <span class="dialog">“What a month I’ve had, right? A case and a crash!”</span> She laughs nervously. It’s probably time to check on other people.
