            <span class="dialog">“Let me introduce myself. I’m Professor Keral, I teach engineering classes at the University of Austin.”</span> You assume he wants to start a casual conversation to ease your shock, while you walk towards the aircraft. <span class="dialog">”Not the safe flight the pilot promised us, huh?”</span> Your mind doesn’t even process what is happening, and that’s all you manage to say. You reach the aircraft and separate from the Professor to start looking for people. Fortunately, there does not appear to be any lifeless body around. You meet the Professor again in the middle of the ruins. <span class="dialog"> “I haven’t found anyone. Let’s go back.”</span> However, you manage to see the back of the head of what appears to be a person, still seated. You run towards the person and just by taking a quick look, you can conclude they are dead. <span class="dialog"> “I didn’t want you to see this”</span> You hear the Professor say from behind you. The victim is a middle-aged woman, that seems to have been typing on her laptop before the crash. You take a look at her laptop and notice that she was checking her email. <span class="dialog"> “She was a journalist… She was emailing her supervisor, ensuring that she would finish the story she was working on during the trip. She had no clue what was about to happen…”</span> You say, fighting the urge to cry at the situation. <span class="dialog"> “Nobody expected it… C’mon, let’s go.”</span> The Professor tries to calm you down, but you can sense the urge on his tone.
