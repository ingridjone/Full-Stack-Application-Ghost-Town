            After the sun has set and what seems to be hours have passed, multiple helicopters reach the crash site. Everyone starts cheering and celebrating the fact that they will be able to return home soon. However, the four people you have talked to, seem suspiciously quiet. Throughout the night, multiple helicopters and police cars eventually transport the survivors to a nearby police station. After waiting for a while, one of the policemen, asks you to enter an interrogation room. After a bit of small talk, which you believe is just him attempting to assess your mental state, he says in a serious tone <span class="dialog">“We have been told there was a dead victim on the plane, before the aircraft exploded. She was a journalist working on an important case. I want you to be honest with me because we are dealing with a murder here, okay?”</span> You quietly ansewer <span class="dialog">“Yes, I understand”</span> The officer does not seem convinced. <span class="dialog">“I want you to tell me if you saw someone acting in a suspicious manner. Keep in mind that you are one of the few witnesses for a case in which the scene and corpse have been completely destroyed, so your testimony carries a lot of weight.”</span> You debate who you should mention. From all the people you talked to, all of them seem to be hiding something. But who would want to kill a journalist?          </p>
