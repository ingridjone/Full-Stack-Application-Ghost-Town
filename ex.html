            A few months after the incident, you are still attempting to recover from what you went through. However, you cannot help yourself but follow the criminal investigation that is constantly being reported in the news. You were called to act as a witness and were questioned about Xavier’s involvement. You recalled how he attempted to hide his laptop screen and how short and blunt he was during the conversation you had with him.
            One day, after many months of trial updates, you read this headline from your local newspaper:
            <p>
            <span class="dialog">“Engineer involved in a plane crash revealed to have murdered a journalist present in the same flight to avoid the publication of a story that detailed how the engineer hacked into the banking company he worked for and stole millions of dollars from third-party vendors. His role as a cloud engineer gave him access to multiple points of contact and contract templates that he was able to alter to redirect the money to an offshore account”<span>
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              What?! Xavier planned the whole event? He ensured the plane would have to perform a non-lethal emergency landing, stabbed the victim with a broken glass, and planted a bomb that would destroy the evidence! He had planned to become a victim of a plane crash, so no one would suspect he was actually a murderer… 
              As you stare at the article in shock, you attempt to process the fact that the most traumatic event of your life was actually a murderer’s sick plan.
