            While you wait for him to come back, you spark a conversation with a brown-haired woman and you learn that the older man’s name is Professor Keral. He teaches an engineering classes at the University of Austin. After what seems to be an eternity, the Professor approaches the group and shares the news. <span class="dialog">“I found a woman, but she was already dead when I got there.”</span> You hear gasps. <span class="dialog">“How did she die? The crash was not deadly, we are all alive!”</span> The brown-haired woman exclaims. <span class="dialog">“Are you suggesting someone murdered her?”</span> A panicked younger guy with glasses cautiously asks. <span class="dialog">“I am a police officer; I can go check on her.”</span> A dark-haired woman responds, while showing her police badge that reads “Agent Moore”. The Professor quickly interjects <span class="dialog">“That is a dangerous idea, the plane could explode at any…”.</span> Suddenly, a great explosion blows up the remainder of the aircraft. You hear multiple screams followed by a long silence. After a bit, the group resorts to waiting for a rescue plane to locate the crash site.
