            You reunite with the group and the Professor shares the news with the others. <span class="dialog">“We found a woman, but she was already dead when we got there.”</span> You hear gasps. <span class="dialog">“I also found a stab wound on her.”</span> You add. You found a stab wound on her neck while examining the body. Furthermore, it seems the woman was carrying a suitcase, since it was placed under her seat. <span class="dialog">“A stab wound?”</span> A brown-haired woman exclaims. <span class="dialog">“So, someone murdered her?”</span> A panicked younger guy with glasses cautiously asks. <span class="dialog">“She could’ve cut herself with broken glass.”</span> A dark-haired woman responds. <span class="dialog">“I am a police officer; I can go check on her.”</span> The dark-haired woman responds, while showing her police badge that reads “Agent Moore”. The Professor quickly interjects <span class="dialog">"That is a dangerous idea, the plane could explode at any…”</span>. Suddenly, a great explosion blows up the remainder of the aircraft. You hear multiple screams followed by a long silence. After a bit, the group resorts to waiting for a rescue plane to locate the crash site.
