            The younger guy with glasses is frantically typing on his laptop. <span class="dialog">“Hey, what’s your name? Do you need help?”</span> You inquire. <span class="dialog">“I’m Xavier. Nice to meet you.”</span> He responds. He does not seem to want to talk. <span class="dialog">“What are you doing?”</span> You ask. <span class="dialog">“Well, it’s none of your business, but since we’ll be stuck here for a while, I am doing work.”</span> Even though he has made it clear he’s not enjoying the conversation, you decide to investigate further. <span class="dialog">“What do you do for work, if you don’t mind me asking?”</span> He quickly interjects <span class="dialog">“I do mind you asking, but I will make the effort of answering that if you leave me alone after.”</span> You get the feeling that he seems to be attempting to hide his laptop screen. <span class="dialog">“Sure”</span> You respond. <span class="dialog">“I am a cloud engineer for a banking company.”</span> You nod, even though you have no idea what cloud engineers do, or if it’s even an actual job. You should honor the deal you made with him and leave him alone.
