            A few months after the incident, you are still attempting to recover from what you went through. However, you cannot help yourself but follow the criminal investigation that is constantly being reported in the news. You were called to act as a witness and were questioned about Moore’s involvement. You recalled how she was accused of abusing her power while on the job, and how she was on her way to defend herself in court.
            One day, after many months of trial updates, you read this headline from your local newspaper:
            <p>
            <span class="dialog">“Police officer involved in a plane crash revealed to have murdered a journalist present in the same flight to avoid the publication of a story that detailed how the officer would accept multiple bribes from underground gambling operators. The criminals would organize underground poker games that involved gambling millions, from which the police officer would gain a small percentage in exchange of not reporting them”<span>
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              What?! Moore planned the whole event? She ensured the plane would have to perform a non-lethal emergency landing, stabbed the victim with a broken glass, and planted a bomb that would destroy the evidence! She had planned to become a victim of a plane crash, so no one would suspect she was actually a murderer… 
              As you stare at the article in shock, you attempt to process the fact that the most traumatic event of your life was actually a murderer’s sick plan.
